# Rootstrap - Create Rootstrap App

We build this CLI to speed up our process to start a new react native project using our React Native Base,
so we can move faster at the start of any new react native project.

We build this project highly inspired in `create-obytes-app` and `ignite-template` ⭐️

### Usage

`npx create-rootstrap-app@latest APP_NAME`

### Then

You can `cd APP_NAME` and try to run your app using the following command:

`npm run ios:dev || npm run android:dev`
