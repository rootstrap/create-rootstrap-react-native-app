# Rootstrap - Create Rootstrap React Native App ⭐️

You can build any react native app using our template that have some additional benefits like:

- Multiple environments pre-configured (Dev, QA, Staging, Prod) for iOS and Android
- Support of environment variables using [react-native-config](https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config)
- React Navigation with Typescript support
- React query for network state management
- Zustand for local state management (Persisted using [react-native-mmkv](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv))

We build this project highly inspired in `create-obytes-app` and `ignite-template`
